# Git and GitHub

Git is a local control system / local repository
GitHub is a cloud repository website, website that is integrated with git system,
 shareable repository/ location, that produces shareable link.


Git:
- local vs cloud
- create project -> enable git (enable VCS) -> define origin(cloud) ->
    ->add the cloud link (add origin)
    -> create repository on the GitHub -> use the link as origin
    -> configure globlal git configuration (name, email)
    -> add and commit, push, pull
